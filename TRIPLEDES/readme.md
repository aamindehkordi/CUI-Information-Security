# Repository Name

This repository contains Python files that implement various cryptographic algorithms. The purpose of this README file is to provide an overview of the contents of the repository and the functionality of each Python file.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `core`: Contains the core functionality for the cryptographic algorithms.
- `descore`: Contains the implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.
- `tdescore`: Contains the implementation of the Triple DES (TDES) algorithm.
- `cui_des`: Contains the wrapper classes for DES and TDES algorithms.
- `the_sauce.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the usage of the implemented algorithms.

## Python Files

### `core.py`

This file contains the core functionality for the cryptographic algorithms. It includes common functions and utilities used by other modules in the repository.

### `descore.py`

The `descore.py` file implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. It provides functions for encryption and decryption using DES in different modes such as ECB, CBC, and OFB.

### `tdes.py`

The `tdes.py` file contains the implementation of the Triple DES (TDES) algorithm. It provides functions for encryption and decryption using TDES in different modes such as ECB, CBC, and OFB.

### `des.py`

The `des.py` file includes wrapper classes for the DES and TDES algorithms. It provides an easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting data using DES or TDES with different modes.

### `the_sauce.ipynb`

The `the_sauce.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file demonstrates the usage of the implemented cryptographic algorithms. It includes examples and explanations for each algorithm, as well as instructions on how to use them.

## Usage

To use the implemented cryptographic algorithms, follow the instructions provided in the respective Python files or refer to the examples in the `the_sauce.ipynb` notebook.
